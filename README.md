### Task Background

We have provided two folders, each containing two PDFs. 
- The first file is a company's application for insurance. This application is created by Limit. ("Limit Application")
  It contains several questions and answers about the company.
- The second file is the same company's application for insurance, but generated by a different insurance firm. ("Second Application")
  It also contains several questions and answers about the company.

The questions (or answers) are not always the same. The problem that you are trying to solve is that given one insurance application,
you want to fill out another insurance application, but the questions may have differences. For example, one application may ask:
- "What is the company's predicted revenue for 2024?"
And another application might ask:
- "What was the company's revenue for 2023?"
Practically, the answers to both questions will be the same number. (It would not be feasible for the company to answer
many different variations of the same question.)

### Task

You are to write code that performs the following:

**Input**
Accept a Limit Application and a Second Application. (The Second Application may or may not have answers in it.)
These will be supplied as sequential command-line arguments, e.g. `python3 application-01-input.pdf application-02-output.pdf`

**Processing**
Extract the questions and answers in the Limit Application, and just the questions in the Second Application.
Using the answers in the Limit Application, create answers to the questions in the Second Application.

**Output**
A textfile listing all the questions in the second application, and appropriate answers to them.
